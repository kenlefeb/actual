## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Registration forms
The coverage check SHALL find a handler registered as `app.method('name', ...)` or as `handlers['name'] = ...`, and SHALL treat both forms the same: the name needs a manifest entry unless it is in the upstream baseline. It SHALL read whole files, so a registration that spans lines is found, and SHALL skip files under `server/tests/` and `__mocks__/`, whose routes are mocks and not handlers. A call such as `handlers['name'](args)`, a comparison or a reference SHALL NOT count as a registration. The baseline SHALL record both forms from the upstream ref it is built from.

#### Scenario: A registration across lines
- **GIVEN** a handler registered as `app.method(\n  'account-set-business-days',\n  ...)`
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it finds `account-set-business-days`

#### Scenario: An assigned handler without coverage
- **GIVEN** a PR adds `handlers['zz-new-handler'] = async () => {}` in `loot-core/src/server/main.ts`, outside the upstream baseline, and no manifest entry
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it fails and names `zz-new-handler`

#### Scenario: An assigned handler with an entry
- **GIVEN** the same registration and a manifest entry `{ "skip": "UI only" }` for `zz-new-handler`
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it passes

#### Scenario: An assigned handler across lines
- **GIVEN** a handler registered as `handlers[\n  'zz-new-handler',\n] = mutator(...)`
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it finds `zz-new-handler`

#### Scenario: A call is not a registration
- **GIVEN** code that reads `await handlers['load-budget']({ id })`, compares `handlers['x'] === y` or passes `handlers['x']` as an argument, and `load-budget` is not in the baseline
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** none of these is found as a registration

#### Scenario: The baseline holds assigned handlers
- **WHEN** the baseline is rebuilt with `--baseline-from upstream/master`
- **THEN** it lists upstream's `handlers['name'] = ...` registrations (82 at the time of writing) beside its `app.method` registrations, so none of them needs an entry

#### Scenario: A mock route is not a handler
- **GIVEN** a route registered as `app.post('/zz-mock', ...)` in a file under `server/tests/` or `__mocks__/`, and a real handler registered elsewhere
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it finds the real handler and not `/zz-mock`
